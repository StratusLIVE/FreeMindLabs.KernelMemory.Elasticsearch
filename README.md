Use [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) as vector storage for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.ms) **[Kernel Memory](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-memory)** (KM)

Kernel Memory (KM) is an open-source service and plugin specialized in the efficient indexing of datasets through custom continuous data hybrid pipelines.

Utilizing advanced embeddings and LLMs, the system enables Natural Language querying for obtaining answers from the indexed data, complete with citations and links to the original sources.

This repository contains the Elasticsearch adapter that allows KM to use Elasticsearch as vector database.

## Goals
1. To implement an Elasticsearch [IMemoryDB](https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory/blob/adce865a472728f2549428cf6b82ca79a601582b/service/Abstractions/MemoryStorage/IMemoryDb.cs#L9) connector for Kernel Memory..
    1. This allows to use Elasticsearch as vector database directly from Kernel Memory.
	1. KM can also be used as memory store for [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel).

## Show me the money

Here are some screenshots of the connector in action.




## Pre-requisites
1. A running instance of Elasticsearch 8 
    - *Semantic search does not seem to be available in v7*.
    - Please follow the instructions at [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.11/install-elasticsearch.html) to install and configure Elasticsearch.
1. Make sure you have the following information, as they will be needed for configuration:
    1. The **user name** and **password** to connect to ES.
    1. The **certificate fingerprint** generated by the ES server.    

## Configuration
The configuration instructions can be found [here](CONFIGURATION.md).




## Current status
1. The connector is currently in development and not ready for production use yet.
1. The connector is not yet available as a NuGet package.

## Timeline
1. We hope to complete this project and the associated documentation by the end of 2023.


## Challenges
The new API in the Elasticsearch client is not yet feature complete and there are bugs.

1. AutoMap(),etc. missing
    1. [CreateIndexDescriptor Mappings -> Map Api usage issue #7929](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues/7929)
    1. [FEATURE - Support AutoMap to allow creation of mappings using type inference #6610](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues/6610)
        1. flobernd comment on Aug 17 suggests this:
```
var mapResponse = client.Indices.PutMapping("index", x => x
    .Properties<Person>(p => p
        .DenseVector(x => x.Data, d => d
            .Index(true)
            .Similarity("dot_product"))));
```


## Resources

1. Elastic's official docs on the client.
    1. NEST 7.17: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/7.17/nest-getting-started.html
    1. New client 8.9: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/8.9/introduction.html
        1. This client is not yet feature complete.
            1. Look here for details: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/current/release-notes-8.0.0.html
        1. In addition, the docs are not up to date. For some stuff we need to lok at NEST's docs.
